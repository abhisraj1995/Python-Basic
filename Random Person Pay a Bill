Random Person Pay a Bill
This is a Python program that randomly selects a person from a list and assigns them the 
task of paying a bill. It provides a fun way to decide who should take on the responsibility
of paying for a meal, outing, or any shared expense.





import random

name=input('Can u give me a name of all the person after that i will decide who gonna pay a bill:- ')

names=name.split(',')

type(print(names))

x=random.randint(0,len(names)-1)

print(x,names[x])
